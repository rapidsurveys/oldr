\title{An Implementation of Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)}
\description{
\href{https://www.helpage.org/}{HelpAge International},
\href{http://www.validinternational.org}{VALID International}, and
\href{http://www.brixtonhealth.com}{Brixton Health}, with financial
assistance from the
\href{http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/}{Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF)},
have developed a \strong{Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)}
that provides accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people.
The method uses simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two
weeks including training, data collection, data entry, and data analysis),
and at considerably lower cost than other methods.
}
\details{
The \strong{RAM-OP} method is based on the following principles:

\enumerate{
\item Use of a familiar \emph{“household survey”} design employing a two-stage
cluster sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary sample
(\eqn{m \geq 16} clusters) and a small overall (\eqn{n \geq 192}) sample.

\item Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including
prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using,
whenever possible, standard and well-tested indicators and question sets.

\item Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to
allow estimates of indicator levels to be made with useful precision using
a small sample size.
