<p>Older people (generally defined as people aged sixty years and older)
are a vulnerable group for malnutrition in humanitarian and
developmental contexts. Due to their age they have specific nutritional
needs, such as easily digestible and palatable food adapted to those
with chewing problems, which is dense in nutrients. In famine and
displacement situations where populations are dependent on food
distributions, older people often find the general ration inappropriate
to their tastes and needs, have difficulties accessing the
distributions, or have difficulties transporting rations home. As a
result, older people can become malnourished and in need of specifically
targeted food interventions. In times of drought or food scarcity, older
people tend to reduce their food intake in order to share or give up
their ration to younger members of their families. They are then at risk
of malnutrition.</p>
<p>Despite these potential vulnerabilities in humanitarian situations,
older people are rarely identified as a group in need of specific
nutritional or food assistance. Surveys and assessments almost always
focus on children, and sometimes on pregnant and lactating women.
Humanitarian workers argue that assessing the nutritional status and
needs of older people is both costly and complicated. As a consequence,
the nutritional status and needs of older people in crisis go
unidentified and unaddressed.</p>
<p>HelpAge International, VALID International, and Brixton Health, with
financial assistance from the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF), have
developed a Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP) that
provides accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people.
The method uses simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two
weeks including training, data collection, data entry, and data
analysis), and at considerably lower cost than other methods. The RAM-OP
method is based on the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use of a familiar “household survey” design employing a two-stage
cluster sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary
sample ( m ≥ 16 clusters) and a small overall ( n ≥ 192)
sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people
(including prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition)
using, whenever possible, standard and well-tested indicators and
question sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods
to allow estimates of indicator levels to be made with useful precision
using a small sample size.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following tools are currently available under the General Public
Licence / Free Documentation License, meaning that you are free to copy
and adapt these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an English language manual / guidebook</p></li>
<li><p>a questionnaire (available in English and French)</p></li>
<li><p>data entry and data checking software (available in English and
French)</p></li>
<li><p>data analysis software.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that the availability of a rapid, low-cost, and
user-friendly method will encourage governments, UN agencies, as well as
international and local non-governmental organisations to actively
assess the situation of older people in humanitarian contexts, and
implement, monitor, and evaluate relevant and timely responses to
address their needs.</p>
