# An Implementation of Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)

[HelpAge International](https://www.helpage.org/), VALID International,
and [Brixton Health](http://www.brixtonhealth.com), with financial
assistance from the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund
(HIF)](https://www.elrha.org/innovation), have developed a **Rapid
Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)** that provides accurate and
reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses simple
procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including
training, data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at
considerably lower cost than other methods.

## Details

The **RAM-OP** method is based on the following principles:

- Use of a familiar *“household survey”* design employing a two-stage
  cluster sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary
  sample (`m >= 16` clusters) and a small overall (`n = 192`) sample.

- Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including
  prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using,
  whenever possible, standard and well-tested indicators and question
  sets.

- Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to
  allow estimates of indicator levels to be made with useful precision
  using a small sample size.
