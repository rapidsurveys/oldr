[HelpAge International](https://www.helpage.org), [VALID International](http://www.validinternational.org), and [Brixton Health](http://www.brixtonhealth.com), with financial assistance from the [Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF)](http://www.elrha.org/hif/home/), have developed a **Rapid Assessment Method for Older People (RAM-OP)** that provides accurate and reliable estimates of the needs of older people. The method uses simple procedures, in a short time frame (i.e. about two weeks including training, data collection, data entry, and data analysis), and at considerably lower cost than other methods. The **RAM-OP** method is based on the following principles:

* Use of a familiar *“household survey”* design employing a two-stage cluster sample design optimised to allow the use of a small primary sample (*m ≥ 16 clusters*) and a small overall (*n ≥ 192*) sample.

* Assessment of multiple dimensions of need in older people (including prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition) using, whenever possible, standard and well-tested indicators and question sets.

* Data analysis performed using modern computer-intensive methods to allow estimates of indicator levels to be made with useful precision using a small sample size.

## Installation

You can install `oldr` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

```{r install-cran, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("oldr")
```

You can install the development version of `oldr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/rapidsurveys/oldr) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rapidsurveys/oldr")
```

## Usage

This package contains functions that support in the data processing, analysis and visualisation of RAM-OP survey datasets collected using the standard RAM-OP survey questionnaire.

The figure below illustrates the RAM-OP workflow and indicates which functions in the `oldr` package support which particular step in the process.

```{r ramOPworkflow, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 10, fig.align = "center"}
